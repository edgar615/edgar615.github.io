Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 2048
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: edgar615
Email address: xxx@qq.com
Comment: 
You selected this USER-ID:
    "edgar615 <xxx@qq.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 231 more bytes)

卡在最后一步，好慢，搜了下

```
sudo apt-get install rng-tools
```

生成结果

查看公钥

```
gpg --list-key
```

查看私钥

```
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

提取公钥

```
gpg -a --export newkey > newkey.asc
```

提取私钥

```
gpg -a --export-secret-keys newkey > newkey_pirv.asc
```

导入密钥

```
gpg --import newkey
```

使用公钥加密文件，生成filename.asc的加密文件

```
gpg -ea -r newkey filename
```

使用私钥解密文件，把filename.asc的加密文件解密成filename文件

```
gpg -o filename -d filename.asc
```

删除私钥

```
gpg --delete-secret-key newkey
```

删除公钥

```
gpg --delete-key newkey
```
